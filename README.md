# C-Library

Library where I will add some functions (algorithms) that I learn and find interesting/useful.
This will be quite a long term project, as I plan to add things as I learn them.

Starting ideas:
-> bubblesort an array
-> square root of a number
-> pow of a number
-> factorial of a number
-> add N numbers
-> find all prime numbers in array
